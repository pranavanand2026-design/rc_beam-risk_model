# Model Artifacts

Trained classifiers, regressors, and blend weights generated by `scripts/05_train_hybrid.py` and `scripts/06_train_frt.py` should be stored under `models/checkpoints/`.

The directory is intentionally empty in source control so releases always rebuild models from the latest code and data.
