# Data Directory

Place the Bhatt et al. dataset (or any compatible spreadsheet) inside `raw/` as `dataset.xlsx`. The preprocessing scripts will write cleaned parquet/CSV artefacts into `processed/` during `02_preprocess.py`.

These files are ignored from git to keep the repository lightweight and to respect data licensing.
